  I needed a public place to put some thoughts, where I could revise 
  what people see very easily.  The material should be considered highly unstable 
  and it's quite possible I might decide to delete it at any moment.

Well hmm.  I guess what you might be interested to know might be [here](../0)?

I don't understand "permalink: /about/" (in the configuration for this page).
