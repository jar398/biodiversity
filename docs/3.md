"Meaning of a sentence"  ???

The topic here is communication and meaning.  A classic example in
ethology is the [vervet monkey signalling
system](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p016dgw1).  The vervet money
speaks a "language" consisting of calls, or what I sometimes describe
as "atomic sentences", atomic because they are not built out of
smaller pieces (e.g. words).  Translated into English, the calls or
sentences would be "watch out, there's a leopard" or "watch out,
there's a snake".  Or, to say the same thing another way, the calls or
sentences mean that there is a leopard/snake nearby and you should
watch out.
