# layout: page
---

I needed a place to put some thoughts in a public place where I could
easily revise what people see at a particular URL.

This is because I like collaboration.  I don't think by myself nearly
as clearly as I do when other people are listening and asking
questions.

I intend to use this site as an incubator for some kind of vocabulary
to be used as CVS table headings, RDF URIs, and so on.

Eventually if I like one of the pages enough, I may migrate it out to
a URL (or URI or IRI) whose resolution is more permanent than however
it is you got here.  Then I will feel better about putting it in files
that go into permanent public repositories such as Zenodo.

I plan to start creating pages whose names are smallish integers like [1](1).
